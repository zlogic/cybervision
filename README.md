# Cybervision
Cybervision is a 3D reconstruction software for Scanning Electron Microscope images.
It's an abandoned project, but can be useful as a working example for many, many technologies, such as:
* [Qt 5.15](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.15/) (including threads, vectors, graphics and 3D rendering)
* [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
* [libsift library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libsift/)
* [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/)

and of course, 3D reconstruction in general.
