# Cybervision
Cybervision is a 3D reconstruction software for Scanning Electrin Microscope images.
It's an abandoned project, but can be useful as a working example for many, many technologies, such as:
* Qt (including threads, vectors, graphics and OpenGL)
* Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/ )
* libsift library (https://sourceforge.net/projects/libsift/)
* OpenCL

and of course, 3D reconstruction in general.
